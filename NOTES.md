# Navbar Structure

For the navbar, we want a few things:
The logo, visible both on mobile and desktop
the button to hide and show the nav visible on mobile only
The Nav content in 2 parts
  - the part that's visible on large screens and mobile (wrapped in a `ul` tag)
  - the part that's only visible on large screens when the more button is expanded (wrapped in a div) 
In mobile view, the navbar content should be transformed off screen
